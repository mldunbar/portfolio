        I've been coding actively since May 2015
        and my progress is extensively documented on Github,
        from my first failed attempts at a calculator
        to my final capstone project and beyond.

        Before May, I led a nomadic lifestyle, <a href="http://hikehydratesleep.blogspot.com/">hiking across Spain</a>,
        living in Vietnam for a while, working in an multicultural office
        and traveling a part of the globe I’d never seen before.

      I returned to Greenville, SC to build a life near family in the Blue Ridge
      foothills, and am working as a line cook at a
      <a href="http://swamprabbitcafe.com/">grocery store</a> that supports local farmers
      and the surrounding community.

      I’m a graduate of Louisiana State University with a degree in English
      and a strong focus on journalism. Some of my older articles and opinion
      columns can be found <a href="http://www.lsureveille.com/search/?t=article&s=start_time&sd=desc&d1=3+years+ago&q=megan+dunbar">here</a>.

      I also attended an <a href="http://www.scgsah.org/">arts-focused boarding school</a> where
      I studied creative writing and began getting some poetry
      and fiction works published.
